    <h2><p>What is Frozen Hot Chocolate?</p></h2>
    <p>There are two very important things to remember when it comes to serving frozen hot chocolate: Drink it as soon as you blend it (although it still tastes pretty good melted) and do not forget to top it off with a generous serving of homemade whipped cream.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>4 cups ice</li>
        <li>2 cups chocolate milk</li>
        <li>1 cup powdered hot chocolate mix</li>
        <li>whipped cream (optional)</li>
        <li>chocolate shavings or sprinkles</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Preparation</h4>
